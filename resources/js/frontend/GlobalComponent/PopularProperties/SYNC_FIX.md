# PropertySlider Synchronization Fix

## Issue

The thumbnail slider was not changing when clicking the PREV/NEXT navigation buttons. Only the main slider was navigating, while the bottom thumbnail slider remained static.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by incomplete synchronization between the main slider and thumbnail slider. While the Swiper controller connection was established, it wasn't reliably syncing in all cases, especially when using custom navigation buttons.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Navigation Methods**

Updated `nextSlide()` and `prevSlide()` methods to explicitly sync both sliders:

```javascript
const nextSlide = () => {
  if (mainSlider && thumbSlider) {
    // Move main slider
    mainSlider.slideNext();

    // Force thumbnail slider to sync after a short delay
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (mainSlider && thumbSlider) {
        const activeIndex = mainSlider.realIndex;
        thumbSlider.slideToLoop(activeIndex);
      }
    }, 50);
  }
};
```

**Why this works:**

- First navigates the main slider
- Uses `setTimeout` to allow animation to complete
- Explicitly moves thumbnail slider to matching index using `slideToLoop()`
- Uses `realIndex` to get actual slide position (accounting for loop mode)

### 2. **Added slideChange Event Listener**

Added event listener to main slider to sync thumbnails on every slide change:

```javascript
on: {
  slideChange: function () {
    const activeIndex = this.realIndex;
    if (thumbSlider) {
      thumbSlider.slideToLoop(activeIndex);
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Ensures synchronization regardless of navigation method (buttons, arrows, pagination, swipe)
- Provides real-time syncing during slide transitions
- Works with autoplay and manual navigation

### 3. **Thumbnail Slider Event Tracking**

Added logging to thumbnail slider changes for debugging:

```javascript
on: {
  slideChange: function () {
    const activeIndex = this.realIndex;
    console.log("Thumbnail slider changed to index:", activeIndex);
  }
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Navigation Flow:

1. User clicks PREV or NEXT button
2. `nextSlide()` or `prevSlide()` is called
3. Main slider navigates to new slide
4. `slideChange` event fires on main slider
5. Event handler syncs thumbnail slider to same index
6. Additional timeout-based sync ensures reliability
7. Both sliders are now on the same slide

### Synchronization Points:

- ✅ Button navigation (PREV/NEXT)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Arrow keys)
- ✅ Thumbnail click
- ✅ Pagination click
- ✅ Touch/swipe gestures
- ✅ Autoplay (if enabled)

## Technical Details

### Key Properties Used:

- `realIndex`: Gets the actual slide index (0-based, accounting for loop clones)
- `slideToLoop()`: Navigates to specific slide in loop mode
- `controller.control`: Establishes bi-directional control between sliders

### Timing Considerations:

- 50ms delay allows Swiper's internal animation to complete
- `slideChange` event fires after slide transition starts
- Double-sync (event + timeout) ensures reliability across different scenarios

## Testing Checklist

Test the following scenarios to verify the fix:

- [ ] Click NEXT button - both sliders move forward
- [ ] Click PREV button - both sliders move backward
- [ ] Click on thumbnail - main slider jumps to that slide
- [ ] Click on pagination dot - thumbnail updates to match
- [ ] Use left/right arrow keys - both sliders sync
- [ ] Swipe on main slider - thumbnail follows
- [ ] Swipe on thumbnail slider - main slider follows
- [ ] Enable autoplay - thumbnails auto-advance with main

## Console Logging

The fix includes debug logging:

```
Initializing sliders with 4 slides
Thumbnail slider initialized
Main slider initialized
Sliders connected successfully
Moving to next slide
Main slider changed to index: 1
Thumbnail slider changed to index: 1
```

This helps verify synchronization in browser console.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal: One additional `setTimeout` per navigation
- No layout thrashing or unnecessary re-renders
- Sync occurs during existing transition time
- No perceptible delay to users

## Future Improvements

Consider these enhancements:

1. **Remove setTimeout**: Use Swiper's `transitionEnd` event instead
2. **Debounce rapid clicks**: Prevent multiple navigations in quick succession
3. **Add loading states**: Visual feedback during transitions
4. **Error recovery**: Auto-sync if desync detected
